Step into the eerie atmosphere of Silent Hill right from your headquarters. This mod replaces the default background music of the HQ with a curated selection of haunting and iconic tracks from the Silent Hill original soundtracks. Whether you're strategizing, customizing, or just idling, the chilling ambiance will keep you immersed in a more psychological and unsettling tone.

## Included Tracks:

1. Promise
2. Promise (Reprise)
3. Silent Hill 2 – Promise (Reprise) [Cover by Eileen﻿]
4. Theme of Laura
5. White Noiz
6. Heavens Night
7. Overdose Delusion

All audio files were manually processed using Audacity to ensure smooth integration with the game’s environment. This includes:

Careful cutting to match in-game loop and ambience timing
Custom fade-out effects to prevent abrupt audio stops

Where necessary, subtle edits were made to the tracks to preserve atmosphere while fitting within the game’s ambient audio structure. The result is a seamless and immersive soundscape that pays tribute to Silent Hill while enhancing the tone of Ready or Not.


## Limitations:

Due to current in-game limitations in how music is triggered and rotated within the Police HQ environment — where only around three tracks tend to play at a time, often repeating in no consistent order — it's not currently possible to experience the full collection in a single session. So that's why I made 1 song playing at a time files, allowing you to choose your preferred track manually. If future updates expand the game’s audio system to support a more dynamic or extensive playlist, I’ll gladly update this mod to take full advantage of those improvements.

I will also be updating the mod to a better equalization and songs from other Silent Hill games. You can also request in the Post comments a song that you want to see in-game! ❤️
